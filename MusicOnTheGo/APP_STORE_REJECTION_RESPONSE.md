## 1. Guideline 2.1 – Answer: "How would user pay the tuition?"

**How would user pay the tuition?**

MusicOnTheGo does not process payments inside the app. Tuition is paid directly between the student and the teacher, outside the app.

- **In the app:** Students discover teachers, see each teacher’s hourly rate, message teachers, and request lesson times. When a student confirms a booking, they see the teacher’s rate in the booking summary for reference only.
- **Payment:** Students and teachers agree on how to pay (e.g. cash, bank transfer, Venmo, Zelle, or other methods) when they message or meet. Payment happens offline or via the payment method they choose. The app does not collect, store, or process any payment details.
- **Current state:** The app is free to use; we do not charge a platform fee. Our in-app “Payment Method” screen (Settings) states that the app is free for now and that payment is arranged directly between students and teachers.

So: users (students) pay tuition by paying the teacher directly, using whatever method they agree on—the app only facilitates finding teachers, messaging, and booking lesson times.

## 2. Guideline 2.3.3 – Screenshots (6.5" iPhone)

Apple said: *"The 6.5-inch iPhone screenshots show an iPhone device frame. Screenshots should highlight the app's core concept..."*

### What to do

1. **Remove the device frame**  
   For 6.5" iPhone, upload **screenshots of the app content only**, without a phone bezel/mockup. Apple wants to see the app’s UI and value, not a marketing-style device frame.

2. **Required size for 6.5" iPhone**  
   - **1242 x 2688 px** (portrait) or **2688 x 1242 px** (landscape).  
   - In App Store Connect: **App Store** → your app → **App Store** tab → **iPhone 6.5" Display** (or “View All Sizes in Media Manager” if needed).

3. **What each screenshot should show**  
   Use **real in-app screens** that show the app in use:
   - **Student:** Dashboard with “Available Teachers” or “Teachers in my city,” teacher profile, or booking/lesson list.
   - **Teacher:** Dashboard with schedule/bookings or students.
   - Avoid using only splash or login as the main screens; use 1–2 at most and lead with feature screens.

4. **Check consistency**  
   - Screenshots must match the app on the correct device (iPhone screens for iPhone, iPad for iPad).
   - They should match the app in all languages you support.

### How to capture (no frame)

- **Simulator:** Run the app in iPhone 14 Plus / 15 Plus (or equivalent 6.5") simulator → **File → New Screen Shot** (or Cmd+S). Crop if needed so the image is exactly **1242 x 2688** (no extra frame).
- **Device:** Take a screenshot on a 6.5" iPhone, then crop to **1242 x 2688** so it’s content-only (no status bar/notch if you prefer; Apple often shows content only).
- Do **not** place the screenshot inside a separate device frame image before upload.

### After updating

1. Replace the current 6.5" iPhone screenshots with the new ones (content-only, correct size).
2. Save.
3. Resubmit the app (or reply in Resolution Center and submit for review again as instructed).

## 3. Quick checklist before resubmitting

- [ ] Replied to Apple’s message with the **payment/tuition** answer above.
- [ ] Replaced 6.5" iPhone screenshots with **content-only**, **1242 x 2688** images showing real app features (dashboard, teachers, booking/lessons).
- [ ] Confirmed no marketing-only or misleading visuals; screens match the actual app.
- [ ] Submitted for review again (or followed any “Next Steps” in the rejection).

If Apple asks for more detail on payment, you can add: *"We do not use In-App Purchase for lessons; tuition is a direct transaction between the student and the teacher, arranged by them outside the app."*
